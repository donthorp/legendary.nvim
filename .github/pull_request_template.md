## Testing for Regressions

I have tested the following:

- [ ] Creating keymaps via `legendary.nvim`, then triggering via the keymap in all modes (normal, insert, visual)
- [ ] Triggering commands from `legendary.nvim` in all modes (normal, insert, visual)
- [ ] Creating commands via `legendary.nvim`, then running the command manually from the command line
- [ ] `augroup`/`autocmd`s created through `legendary.nvim` work correctly
